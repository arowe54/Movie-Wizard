Usage:
    Bootstrap Icons are SVGs
    can include them into your HTML in a few ways depending on how your project is setup
    recommend using a width: 1em (and optionally height: 1em) for easy resizing via font-size.

Embedded:
    Embed your icons within the HTML of your page (as opposed to an external image file)
    Here we’ve used a custom width and height.

    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-emoji-heart-eyes" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
        <path d="M8 15A7 7 0 1 1 8 1a7 7 0 0 1 0 14zm0 1A8 8 0 1 0 8 0a8 8 0 0 0 0 16z"/>
        <path d="M11.315 10.014a.5.5 0 0 1 .548.736A4.498 4.498 0 0 1 7.965 13a4.498 4.498 0 0 1-3.898-2.25.5.5 0 0 1 .548-.736h.005l.017.005.067.015.252.055c.215.046.515.108.857.169.693.124 1.522.242 2.152.242.63 0 1.46-.118 2.152-.242a26.58 26.58 0 0 0 1.109-.224l.067-.015.017-.004.005-.002zM4.756 4.566c.763-1.424 4.02-.12.952 3.434-4.496-1.596-2.35-4.298-.952-3.434zm6.488 0c1.398-.864 3.544 1.838-.952 3.434-3.067-3.554.19-4.858.952-3.434z"/>
    </svg>

External Image:
    Copy the Bootstrap Icons SVGs to your directory of choice and reference them like normal images with the <img> element.
    
    <img src="/assets/icons/bootstrap.svg" alt="Bootstrap" width="32" height="32">

Icon Font:
    Icon fonts with classes for every icon are also included for Bootstrap Icons. 
    Include the icon web fonts in your page via CSS, then reference the class names as needed in your HTML 

    <i class="bi-alarm"></i>

    Use font-size and color to change the icon appearance.
    <i class="bi-alarm" style="font-size: 2rem; color: cornflowerblue;"></i>


Color can be changed by setting a .text-* class or custom CSS:
ex. <svg class="text-success">
        ...
    </svg>
    Changes colour to the success colour (same as buttons)

Sprite:
    Use the SVG sprite to insert any icon through the <use> element.
    Use the icon’s filename as the fragment identifier (e.g., toggles is #toggles). 
    SVG sprites allow you to reference an external file similar to an <img> element, but with the power of currentColor for easy theming.

    Known Issues:
        ! issue with Chrome where <use> doesn’t work across domains.
        ! External SVG sprites may not function correctly in Internet Explorer. Use the svg4everybody polyfill as needed.
        ! SVGs receive focus by default in Internet Explorer and Edge Legacy. 
            When embedding your SVGs, add focusable="false" to the <svg> element.
        ! When using SVGs with <img> elements, screen readers may not announce them as images, or skip the image completely. 
            Include an additional role="img" on the <img> element to avoid any issues.

    <svg class="bi" width="32" height="32" fill="currentColor">
        <use xlink:href="bootstrap-icons.svg#heart-fill"/>
    </svg>


Accessibility:
    For purely decorative icons, add aria-hidden="true". 
    Otherwise, provide an appropriate text alternative. 
    Depending on which method you’re using to add the icons, and where you’re using them 
    (e.g. as standalone images, or as the only content of a button or similar control), 
    there are various possible approaches. 
    ex.

    <!-- alt="..." on <img> element -->
    <img src="/assets/icons/bootstrap.svg" alt="Bootstrap" ...>

    <svg class="bi" ... role="img" aria-label="Tools">
        <use xlink:href="bootstrap-icons.svg#tools"/>
    </svg>

    <!-- aria-label="..." on the control -->
    <button ... aria-label="Mute">
    <svg class="bi bi-volume-mute-fill" aria-hidden="true" ...>
    ...
    </svg>
    </button>
